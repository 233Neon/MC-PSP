# MC-PSP

MC-PSP is a brand new Minecraft port for the PSP!

# News

v0.3 IS HERE! The game now has infinite worlds, building, and will be gaining more features soon!

## How to Install

1.) Download the installer (Minecraft-PSP.exe) from v0.4 release: <https://github.com/NT-Bourgeois-Iridescence-Technologies/MC-PSP/releases/tag/v0.4>

Note: Some antivirus's false flag this as a Trojan, but I assure you that there is no harm. If you wish to view the install script, look here: <https://gist.github.com/NT-Bourgeois-Iridescence-Technologies/9358ff678038f9cfac0572b0f015d06a>

If you want to see the Antivirus scans, 3 out of 68 find a false flag: <https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/5aeed7d7abe038b2219ea1e25ad49e5cbf8df2fd04e92983f55f3806943e7df7/detection>

2.) Plug in your PSP by USB. For this tutorial we will say that the drive letter is D, but please check with your system.

3.) Run the installer and set your install directory to your D:/PSP/GAME/ folder

*If your PSP can access the internet and you can connect, you are done, and the Launcher will automatically download the newest release!*

### If you want to update manually

1.) After running the installer as described above, if you wish to update to a new version manually, download the .zip from the latest pre-release or snapshot.

2.) Navigate to the D:/PSP/GAME/Launcher/Game folder, then extract the .zip over that directory

3.) This should create a prompt that asks you if you want to replace files. Hit yes.

4.) Rename the 'Game' folder to 'MC-PSP' (it doesn't have to be 'MC-PSP' but this is an example). The path should now be D:/PSP/GAME/Launcher/MC-PSP

5.) Drag 'MC-PSP' out to the D:/PSP/GAME/ folder. Your installation should now be in D:/PSP/Game/MC-PSP

6.) Delete the 'Launcher' Folder

*This will update your PSP to the latest version and you will now skip the launcher*
*To update after doing this, repeat steps 1 - 3 but in the 'MC-PSP' folder instead*
