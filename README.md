# Minecraft2-PSP

Minecraft2-PSP, while still an unofficial name, is a modification and extension of Woolio's Minecraft-PSP Lamecraft Mod, which attempts to optimize and add new features to Lamecraft to bring it up to speed with more modern editions of minecraft. While still in its early stages, Minecraft2-PSP is an ambitious project to build a modern game on old-school console.
