As of version Alpha 0.2, MC-PSP will be undergoing major changes in the fundamental game itself...

Many games aspire to be "clones" of Minecraft... however, I think that we can go a step further and make a truly amazing game by making an "implementation" of Minecraft. An implementation differs from a clone in that it does not only try to replicate behavior externally, but also makes sure that internal usage and data formats are as close to the original game as possible! Starting with v0.3, everything will be written with this design philosophy in mind, and may change the game significantly.
